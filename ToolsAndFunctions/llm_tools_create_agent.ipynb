      "Reasoning: Okay, let's tackle the user's questions. First, they want the sum of 2 and 5 multiplied by 7. Hmm, I need to parse that correctly. The phrase is \"sum of 2 and 5 multiplied by 7.\" So, does that mean (2 + 5) * 7 or 2 + (5 * 7)? The wording says \"sum of 2 and 5\" which is 7, then multiplied by 7. So it's (2+5)*7. That would be 7*7=49. Let me check if the functions available can handle that. The user provided functions for add_numbers, subtract, multiply. So first add 2 and 5, then multiply by 7. So first call add_numbers with a=2, b=5. Then take that result and multiply by 7 using multiply_numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next question: Who won the Women's Cricket World Cup in 2025? Wait, the 2025 Women's Cricket World Cup hasn't happened yet because the current year is 2023. The last tournament was in 2022, and the next one is scheduled for 2025. But since the user is asking for the winner in 2025, which is future, I can't know the actual result. However, the Wikipedia function can be used to look up information. So I should call the wikipedia function with query \"2025 Women's Cricket World Cup winner\" to get the latest information. But if the function returns that the event hasn't occurred yet, then the answer would be that it's not yet determined. Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the year, but the user specified 2025, so I have to proceed with that.\n",
      "\n",
      "So for the first part, two function calls: add_numbers and multiply_numbers. For the second part, use wikipedia with the query about the 2025 tournament.\n",

Sri Lanka had previously hosted the competition in 2012 and India in 2016. A total of twenty teams will compete in 55 matches across five venues in India, and three in Sri Lanka.\n",
      "The number of participants remained as twenty teams, which included teams from the two hosts, the top seven teams from the 2024 edition, the three highest-ranked teams in the ICC Men's T20I Team Rankings not already qualified, and eight other teams determined through regional qualifiers. Italy qualified for the men's T20 World Cup for the first time.\n",
      "India are the defending champions having won the previous edition.\n",
      "Reasoning: Okay, let's tackle the user's query step by step. The user asked for two things: the sum of 2 and 5 multiplied by 7, and the winner of the 2025 Women's Cricket World Cup. \n",
      "\n",
      "First, the mathematical part. The user wrote \"sum of 2 and 5 multiplied by 7.\" I need to parse this correctly. The phrase \"sum of 2 and 5\" means 2 + 5, which equals 7. Then, multiplying that result by 7 gives 7 * 7 = 49. I remember the user previously used the add_numbers and multiply_numbers functions, so I should use those again here. The add_numbers function with a=2 and b=5 gives 7, then multiply_numbers with a=7 and b=7 gives 49. That part seems straightforward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, the cricket world cup question. The user asked who won the 2025 Women's Cricket World Cup. Looking at the tool response, the Wikipedia entry states that India won the tournament by defeating South Africa in the final. The summary mentions India securing their maiden World Cup title. The final was held in Navi Mumbai, and India's victory is confirmed. I need to make sure there's no confusion with other years or tournaments. The tool response also mentions that Australia were the defending champions but were knocked out in the semi-final, so the winner is definitely India. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, compiling both answers into JSON format. The user wants both answers in JSON, so I'll structure it with two keys: \"math_result\" and \"cricket_winner\". The math result is 49, and the cricket winner is India. I should double-check the function calls and the Wikipedia response to ensure accuracy. No conflicting information found, so the final JSON should reflect these results correctly.\n",
